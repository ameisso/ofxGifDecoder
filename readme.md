# ofxGifDecoder

Decode animated gif files in openframeworks.

## UNMAINTAINED : (

Unfortunately I am not using openframeworks these days and haven't had time to bring my addons up to date with recent versions. I don't have the time to review and test pull requests, so if you have an active fork that's up to date let me know and I'll include the link here.

Includes a simple example tested with openframeworks 0.8.1

Functionality is still very scarce. You can:

- draw individual frames, 
- get frame duration info, 
- get the gif palette, etc.

If you like this, you will probably enjoy [ofxGifEncoder](https://github.com/jesusgollonet/ofxGifEncoder) too.
They'll end up living together as ofxGif at some point.

## THANKS
props to [robotconscience](https://github.com/robotconscience/ofxGifDecoder) for fixing frame blending and missing PixelType problem
